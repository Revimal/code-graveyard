"\nYes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his\nbreakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when\nhe used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his\nhighness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan\nthat he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing\nall for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was\nactually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all\nher ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and\nearthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God\nhelp the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and\nlownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was\npious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like\nher a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a\nwelleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here\nand Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her\ndog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats\nespecially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that\nand waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always\nif ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much\nbetter for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I\nsuppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have\na hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till\nthey throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as\nmuch a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre\nsick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was\nO tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he\nsprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day\nI wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones\nshe could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into\na mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying\non account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more\nlike a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same\nbesides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor\nparing his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I\nwas sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it\nnot to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by\nhis appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her\nso either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was\nreally and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it\nplanning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember\nMenton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he\nnot long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and\nturned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what\nharm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to\nhim mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever\nmet and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle\nin bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in\nwith somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as\nI do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a\nletter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the\npaper as if something told me and he covered it up with the\nblottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably\nthat was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all\nmen get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is\nnow so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old\nfool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I\ncare two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though\nId like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my\nnose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace\npadding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell\nof those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by\ngetting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat\nwithout that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was\ndrinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of\ncourse ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table\non Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing\nmy potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if\nyou please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on\nwith that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you\nhave no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters\nbut I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be\nalone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I\nfound in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a\nlittle bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave\nher her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do\nout the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out\nthe dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I\ncouldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar\nand sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the\nplace in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because\nhe couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere\nand the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan\ngave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there\nsteals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb\nto squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he\nhas an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out\nand going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the\nsatisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be\nalways and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking\nboy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id\nconfuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my\ngarters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I\nknow what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging\ndrawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this\nthat and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would\nbecause I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in\nthe jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a\nstranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and\nhe tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he\nis who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it\ntell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine\nIm him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what\nhe never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply\nruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it\ntill he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your\nlips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the\nworld about it people make its only the first time after that its just\nthe ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man\nwithout going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when\nyou feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish\nsome man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in\nhis arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul\nalmost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to\nFather Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and\nI said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my\nchild on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where\nyou sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done\nwith it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put\nit I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he\nwant to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat\nhand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he\nId say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in\nthe box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never\nturn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost\nfor a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them\nId like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense\noff him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre\nmarried hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the\npope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt\nlike his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though\nI laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of\nhis fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it\nwho gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of\ndrink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they\nstick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking\ngreen and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with\nthe opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American\nthat had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do\nto keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took\nthe port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt\nlovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I\npopped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful\nto us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when\nI blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in\nGibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and\ntell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing\nabout nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that\nevening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it\nbrought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to\nchurch mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only\ngrey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I\nlit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that\ntremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or\nwhatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is\nnot so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my\nhours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a\nthick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think\na few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life\nfelt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must\nhave eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with\na big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into\nyou because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious\nlook in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a\ntremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on\nme considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt\nwashed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice\ninvention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if\nsomeone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went\nthrough with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina\nPurefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up\nwith a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a\nsmell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like\na nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the\nlast time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and\nbawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied\ntill they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what\nsupposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was\nmarried Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has\nmore spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting\nJosie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him\noff well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I\nknow they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing\nand sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming\nand then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not\nliking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over\npolitics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a\ncarpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive\nabout everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for\nI knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he\nannoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot\nof mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often\nwanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family\nphysician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was\ncrowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with\nher over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever\nhe asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me\nthe present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that\nfinished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I\nknow how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out\nto see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know\nplenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch\nhim with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them\nall spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of\ncourse would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him\nthat I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love\nhim and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might\nimagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of\na manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it\nout of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and\nwasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the\nnight in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I\nwant to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper\nwith my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too\nmuch the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know\nmore than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie\nwhenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I\nsaid I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash\npossible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick\nwhen hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the\nindifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what\nspoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at\nthat time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was\ntoo beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged\nafterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of\nlaughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling\nout one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great\nhumour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it\nmeant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us\nnot all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault\nshe didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes\ngot like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her\nface beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she\nmust have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment\nshe was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk\nabout him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes\nhe used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him\njust imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might\nmurder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes\nmad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when\nhe comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he\nalways takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and\nnow hes going about in his slippers to look for  10000 for a postcard\nU p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff\nto extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what\ncould you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than\nmarry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like\nme to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and\nhe knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick\nthat poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man\nyes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and\ndo a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating\ndrive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask\nus to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because\nthey cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off\nflypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say\nits from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have\nbeen madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being\nhanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do\nbesides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they\ntheyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he\nnoticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C\nwith Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both\nordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his\ntwo old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it\nwas what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed\nbreeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting\nall myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long\none I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got\nafter some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish\ntimes lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to\nMrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the\nturning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea\n2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him\nbecause I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he\nmeant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that\nif I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill\nstick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still\nI made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of\na concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to\nmull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my\nstockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another\ntime it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I\ncould find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world\nthat I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and\nbeat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because\nthe stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in\nthe Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere\nI noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell\nDArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on\nthe choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting\nfor O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown\npart he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was\nalways raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his\nmouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a\nplace like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him\nabout that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there\nand show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it\nor lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an\nidea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got\nme so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me\nto give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming\nalong Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had\nto take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape\nof my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me\nwhen I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject\nof drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced\nthings on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels\neven when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one\nin the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see\nevery atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain\nI saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the\nHarolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the\nZingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking\nslyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they\ncan go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on\nit and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were\nyou where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me\nhis eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it\nwas getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he\npestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he\nsaid my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an\nexcuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time\ntill I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his\nwaistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in\nthe rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them\nand beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the\nsunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet\nif I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you\nnever know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it\nif anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers\noutside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him\nfrom doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he\ncircumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do\neverything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting\nall the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the\nbutchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me\nthat letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to\nany woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we\nmet asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw\nI wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was\nalways breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky\nman and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake\ndont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it\nused to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in\nGibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children\nseeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice\na day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman\nwhen he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote\nthe night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it\nsimply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to\nembrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the\nsame time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you\nthink its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the\ndoor of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface\nGoodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after\ndinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me\nprofessor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in\nhis way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out\nyou have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I\nthought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches\nfirst and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was\ntrying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he\nmust have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2\nDedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch\nhe gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after\nwhen I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty\nwhen I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even\nput on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week\nwere to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers\nanniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms\nat the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new\nbed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next\nroom or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the\nwall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all\nvery well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we\nnever did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes\ngoing where he is besides something always happens with him the time\ngoing to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for\nthe two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with\nthe soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and\nthe waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion\nfor the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two\ngentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was\ntoo hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a\ngood job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd\nhave taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him\nO I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I\nwonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the\ntrain by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots\nof men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly\nbe that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone\nin the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something\nabout him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the\nwindow all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what\nwould they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last\nconcert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall\nClarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen\nKearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my\nsinging the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts\nwhen I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him\nmanaged it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to\nsing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead\nKindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out\nhe was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some\nold opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein\nlately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and\nnonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very\nintelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats\nall I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I\nhate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and\nLadysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd\nEast Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and\njust the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was\nlovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty\nhe was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the\nroad he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could\nhave made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of\nthe other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of\ndragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their\nfever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love\nto see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish\ncavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from\nAlgeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham\nbattles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the\nmarch past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O\nthe lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made\nhis money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me\na nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen\nup there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like\nI had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going\nround with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave\nthis ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the\nknuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or\ntell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go\nand smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money\nand hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I\ncould find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when\nI looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the\nexpression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with\nhis big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat\nalways having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from\nbehind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the\ndogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so\nquiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the\nway it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish\ntie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly\nwelloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he\nwas like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the\nstoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20\nquid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for\nme on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that\nsponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming\nback that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor\nlooking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first\nnoticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I\nwished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my\nfingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for\nI didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers\nwere hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have\nslipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always\nhanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down\nyour throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a\ngreat compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case\nif its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one\nthing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I\nthink didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them\neither naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she\ndidnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of\nsilkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought\nthem back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one\nchange them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into\nhim and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id\nwant advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips\nhe saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a\ndelightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance\nacross the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill\nhave to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it\nthe last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his\nmoney easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a\ncottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret\nthat he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die\nof the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that\nantifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the\nfashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats\nall he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was\nthe face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like\nnew I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place\nand dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to\nhim Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to\nwash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax\nand violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the\nskin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger\nafter the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry\nhandkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world\nwithout style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it\naround I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea\ninto the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues\nitself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all\nthe brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners\n3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the\nother the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because\nthey know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every\nday for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all\nIll be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith\nshes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys\non the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down\nto her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham\nstreet 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it\nas if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the\nday before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of\nWales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads\nonly for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black\nmans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny\nstory about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster\nknife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and\nthe prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing\nlike that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master\nFrancois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her\near because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and\nher ae as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that\npretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody\ncan see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that\ntwice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs\nhim up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a\nwoman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out\nof her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the\ncrib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have\na child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of\nher side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and\nshe a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar\nthe year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted\nthe tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me\ntoo if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to\nchuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it\nand go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank\nwhere they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day\nof course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with\nhim any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe\nlike father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching\nabout for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still\nonly for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could\nhave got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada\nonce or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly\nMrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I\nlost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming\ninto fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no\ngood by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as\nI said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot\nof trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me\naltogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and\ncooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I\nwent by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes\ntake that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles\noff my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my\nbackside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in\nGrafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as\ninsolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were\ngiving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of\nher yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second\ntime he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see\nhim looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for\nme it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs\nBloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him\nbeing insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled\nI know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely\nsorry and Im sure you were\nyes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he\nmade me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one\nanyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep\nthat up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out\nfor him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2\nthe same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up\nthere like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide\nit with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a\nman looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down\nout of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it\nwith a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat\nmarket or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the\nstatue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was\npissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one\nside the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved\nthem theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed\noutside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to\ntry some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7\nwonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night\ncoming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade\nto make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting\ncold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was\na few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see\nme squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it\nbefore I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not\nafraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the\nwoman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for\na picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the\njob in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee\npalace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes\nonly shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish\nphoto he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her\nand that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some\njawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply\nthe way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of\nthe pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his\nteeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent\nthey fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly\nenough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a\npound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate\nlooking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly\ncaught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to\nmy face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till\nhe got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get\nhim to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker\nthan cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond\neverything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only\ncould remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it\nthe works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an\nhour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant\nI had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those\nmen get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch\nmyself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come\nagain like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when\nhe made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was\ncoming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him\nafter O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or\nanything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain\nwho knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man\ntheyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice\nabout it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my\neyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue\nbetween my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday\ntwo Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday\nfrseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those\nengines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and\nout of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor\nmen that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in\nthose roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half\nof those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying\nabout hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W\nC Ill get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there\nfor the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres\nlast Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the\nhall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and\nrefreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get\nlike Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on\nblack as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big\ngiant compared with their 3 Rock mountain they think is so great with\nthe red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and\nthe smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time\nweltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs\nStanhope

bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was\ngiven the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them\nexpecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic\nall staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or\njump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious\nold Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2\nthings in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the\nwomen were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole\ninsides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all\nmy life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking\nin bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose\ntheyre dead long ago the 2 of them

how to settle it at the back when I put it up\nand whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we\nwere like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in\nher bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning\nwith the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an\nopportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father\nand Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the\nwindows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like\nall needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at\nmyself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was\nattractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent\nlooking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the\nshadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the\nexcitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been\nnice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me\nthe Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East\nLynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by\nthat other woman I lent

even one\ndecent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and\nhis fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my\nshift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the\nchair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on\nthe sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them\nat night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago\nit seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her\naddress right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were\nalways going

said goodbye she had a\nGorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage\nmade very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it\ngot as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run\naway mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or\naunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me\nwaiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and\nbooming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing\neverything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when\ngeneral Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great\nfellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there\nfrom before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the\nson then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums\nrolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with\nmesstins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their\njellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men\nto cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the\ngates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about\nRorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum\nlighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil\nwith his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his\nnose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner\nbut he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room\non some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky\ntalking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along\nI suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a\nletter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with\nbits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails\nlistening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an\ninstrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your\nhotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me\nlooking out of the window if there was a nice

and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a\npoor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some\nadvertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed

nothing else its all very\nfine for them but as for being a woman as soon as youre old they might\nas well throw you out in the bottom of the ashpit.\nMulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio\nbrought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her\nto hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin\nto open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her\nin the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her\nappearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles\nwith all her religion domineering because she never could get over the\nAtlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack\nflying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took\nall the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough\nin Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there\nwas a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black\nblessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on\nEaster Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell\nbringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an\nadmirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him\nup when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window\nthen he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making\nan appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it\nup in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill\ninstructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps\nsinging I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the\nold stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under\nthe Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what\nkissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was\nsweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way\nwhat did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish\nnobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to\nbe married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in\njest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about\nmyself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I\nsuppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all\nthe flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and\nthe perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the\nblack water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it\nwas May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in\nthe spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the\nrockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all\nabout the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail\ncareering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was\na regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and\nthrow stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that\nwhite blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could\nwithout too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was\ntired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be\nthe highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those\nfrightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever\nthey call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots\nIm sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when\nthey die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing\nyes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever\nhe caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I\nwas leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness\nout of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last\nday transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he\nwanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was\nawfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me\nwith a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop\neven if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was\nafraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once\ntook something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered\nwith limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of\nyoud think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with\nyou in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling\nthere so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I\npulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I\nopened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I\nhad a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first\ntickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt\nawokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the\nsame I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got\nover him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back\nthe skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the\nmiddle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was\nhis name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was\nrather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the\nwhatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed\ncome back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed\ndo it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now\nflying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20\nyears if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put\nhis hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young\nstill about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is\nquite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has\nshe little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever\ndreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you\nmight say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I\nwas a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in\nfrom Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and\npigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle\nhill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to\nread out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he\nhadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he\nalways wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso\nswinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long\npreach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle\nand wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and\nme more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that\nwould be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it\nlooked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M\nBloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well\nits better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with\nbottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I\nwouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my\nmother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows\nafter the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along\nWilliss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other\nside of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like\nMillys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down\nat them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars\npulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was\nto write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world\nand back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while\nthey can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up\nWindmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that\nwas dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from\non board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral\nnecklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay\nof Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits\nlike a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the\nsea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at\nthe elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow\nfor the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that\nGibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on\nyou more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me\nthat clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south\nAfrica where

City\nArms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he\nwasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was\nno love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that\nbook he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other\nMr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with\nhis tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white\nshoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather\nall blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell\nof the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan\nbay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the\nfishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa\nand the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to\nclimb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago\nbesides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at\nnight I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of\nsalt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was\ngoing to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or\nBlooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the\nway his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he\nwas going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely\nplaces we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the\ngondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of\nand mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was\ngoing to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry\nmy can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the\nplans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old\nbeggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and\nput his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of\nthat hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in\njail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine\nhis poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles\naway from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows\nto make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a\nmadhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute\nlike that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed\nId cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better\nthan nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and\nhe went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was\nlooking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits\nmaking as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit\nthere isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling\nespecially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl\ndown there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather\ninstead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not\nlike me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the\nsame on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way\nhe plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the\nplace lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming\nin without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as\nI was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then\ndoing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to\nlook at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack\nstatue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got\nthat little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2\nshillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right\nnot to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at\nthe table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to\nunderstand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant\nsay I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and\nhelping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its\nme shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on\nthe shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now\nshes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me\nwhistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly\ncome out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her\nround in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well\nhe sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to\ngo on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I\nsmelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I\nsewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I\ntell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a\nparting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out\nno matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your\nblouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle\nblackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on\nshow on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at\nher like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you\nthen a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the\nTheatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me\nafraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that\ntouching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always\ntrying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for\nBeerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed\nlike that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me\nthere and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to\nget near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same\nlittle game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but\nhe didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the\nBroadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance\non her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands\nswollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything\ndeep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into\nthe wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that\nConny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with\nsealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he\nlooked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and\nsupper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man\ngives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a\nfew men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it\nreally happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love\nin their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each\nother that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit\nfoolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and\npoison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes\nalways making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to\nput her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time\nenough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes\npretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too\nbut theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a\nfishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we\nmet Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to\nsee us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough\ntill I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that\nnow for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me\nthat exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because\nhow was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night\nbefore cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to\nleave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as\nshe said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was\nthe last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself\nthey darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the\ntwo of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever\ngoing to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming\nId have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that\nold Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the\nthings into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course\nshes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly\ndishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something\nand opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends\nto entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you\nplease that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father\nsuch a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the\ncricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at\nthe other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won\nthem in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody\nsaw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand\nfuneral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody\nhawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head\nI ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been\nhanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the\nironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was\nsomething else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and\nnow shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband\ngetting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they\nhave to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats\nher Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres\nsome new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead\nin my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if\nIm let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt\nthat afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he\nhad up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that\npester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows\ntheres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual\nmonthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like\nthat the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him\nto see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about\ninsurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt\ngive in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his\nglasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul\nthats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could\nall in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it\nout then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry\nsupposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery\nhissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a\nwoman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up\nfor it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is\nbetter off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience\nabove its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me\npregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just\nput on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn\nit and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a\nvirgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you\ncould be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do\nor blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this\npooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what\nbetween clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too\njingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the\nother side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor\nwith the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think\nit is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I\nmight look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next\ntime he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face\nwheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me\nafter that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I\nmade him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse\nand skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be\nhe never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits\neasy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling\nlike a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for\na wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning\ndont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look\nhow white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit\nhere how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get\nup on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey\nlily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore\nwho knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I\nsomething growing in me getting that thing like that every week when\nwas it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to\nthe doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that\nwhite thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick\nDr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called\nit I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting\nround those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every\nlittle fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of\ncourse so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last\nman in the world besides theres something queer about their children\nalways smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what\nI did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one\nthing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly\nold face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and\ncould you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the\nrock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by\nthe way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I\ncan squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and\nneedles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by\nMillys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the\nsame paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and\nasking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all\nthe words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked\nsideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows\nwhat else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out\nfrowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you\nlying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever\nenough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad\ncrazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious\nBody everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and\nof joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he\nhad me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I\nhadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him\nup I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited\nme I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in\nRehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes\nas if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking\nafter my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half\nsloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand\nfor a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his\nblather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool\nof a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O\nbeau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and\nrigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy\nanything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st\nopportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom\npretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk\nand sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I\nlaughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight\nsitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so\nthat a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose\nthere isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at\nthe way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard\nbolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth\nbreathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to\nshow one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a\npinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out\nthat he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put\ntogether all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody\nI suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big\nsquare feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway\nwheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt\ncreak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere\nstill she must have given him great value for his money of course he\nhas to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll\nhave something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God\nhelp us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always\nreminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often\nenough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to\nadmire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like\nmy bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses\nwere we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard\nstreet and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on\nthe run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the\nmen with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse\nand worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always\nsomebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always\nknow who was in there last every time were just getting on right\nsomething happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr\nCuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old\nlottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives\nimpudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the\nFreeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the\nfreemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along\nin the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much\nconsolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed\njudging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres\nGeorges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well\nthats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody\nclimbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that\nlittle habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if\nhe has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I\ndont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their\nlies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont\nbelieve you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats\nMasterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in\nreal life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is\ndisgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads\nand no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about\nwith not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow\npoison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both\nsides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let\nhim lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the\none thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews\nused when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast\nor speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough\nfor one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his\nown pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that\nwethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and\nlock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder\nwas it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too\nno hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants\nme and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that\nforlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some\nlittle bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the\nCollege races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his\nnob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at\nthose two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no\nuse of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr\nPaddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in\nthe paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd\nbe something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind\nin black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that\nbit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or\nother and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys\nhusband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye\ntrying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old\ngreen dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way\nlike dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call\nthat friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with\ntheir wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping\nthat barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be\nsick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still\nthough hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of\nthem well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches\nif I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well\nwhen he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to\nsquander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after\nhis wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im\nsorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do\nunless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some\npub corner and her or her son

and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he\nborrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and\nsquashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a\nwellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough\nthat must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the\npreserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and\nSimon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the\nsecond verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly\nsang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying\ntoo when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had\na delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart\n_sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_\ngoodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in\nit all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we\nsang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even\ntransposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed\nsay or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I\nwonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a\nuniversity professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he\ndriving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have\ngot it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look\nyoung in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and\nme too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge\nstation with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago\nnow yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for\nwhat was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for\nme I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted\nhed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time\nhe was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord\nFauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw\nhim at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God\nyes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out\nthe deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met\nbefore I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either\nbesides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after\nthat the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on\nits way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise\nin society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look\nat that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about\npoetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or\nstanding up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only\ngetting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry\nwhen I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not\nan ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I\nwonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15\nyesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose\nhes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not\nthat stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting\ndown in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of\ncourse he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was\nout of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not\na professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson\nthey all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont\nfind many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where\npoetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully\ncoming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point\nthe guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back\nthere again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that\nfor him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly\nbright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young\nstar itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to\ntalk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts\nad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in\ntheir business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like\nto meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young\nthose fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace\nfrom the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or\nsomething and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men\nlike that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely\nlittle statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and\nhis shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and\npoetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his\nlovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth\nif nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and\nwhite he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if\nsome of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no\ndanger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I\nsuppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the\nmost of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure\nitll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age\nIll throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard\ncomes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out\nIll read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew\nwho he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the\nsame and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him\ntill he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and\nmistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he\nbecomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though\nno thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no\nnothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because\nI didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a\ncabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place\npulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so\nbarefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar\nway in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a\nbutcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course\nhes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might\nas well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something\nbetter to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its\nbecause they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he\ncouldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the\namount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white\nfor them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with\nthat thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so\nsoft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those\ncornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has\na thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it\ndidnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts\nhis thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be\nyou put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick\nand choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl\nfor their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street\nno but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me\nup no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands\njealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling\nher husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if\nhe did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he\ngoing to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course\nthe man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either\nits the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all\nthose desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can\nI its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with\nhim so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the\nwrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a\nwomans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything\nunnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of\nus the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the\ndirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita\ntheres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a\nmadman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a\nwoman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young\nno matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the\nfellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking\nwould I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd\nknow me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not\ncare a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of\nthose wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near\nthe Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only\nsent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back\nover and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow\nwith the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me\nup against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do\nthemselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up\nsomewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us\nthe fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course\nit was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and\nwhen I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after\ncoming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his\nwife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten\nagain with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the\nlove of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well\nhe may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he\nknew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to\nsigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for\nLord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around\ndown in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled\nup like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like\nto see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I\ndont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be\ngoverned by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one\nanother and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around\ndrunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on\nhorses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop\nsure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know\nwhat it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they\nall of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I\nnever had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away\nfrom his books and studies and not living at home on account of the\nusual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a\nfine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to\nmake one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two\ndogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that\ndisheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in\nthat little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some\npoor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it\nwas we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into\nthe glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I\nfelt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of\nroving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and\npickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining\nhimself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to\nlove coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends\nthey can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some\nwoman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder\nthey treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I\nsuppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like\nthat he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I\nsuppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the\nnext room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I\nwonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had\nthe devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave\nme the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and\nPisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown\nmyself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the\nbits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and\nCrutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am\na harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day\nolder than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish\ncomo esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all\nI thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person\nplace or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs\nRubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the\ntwo ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the\nSpanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant\nwhat a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and\nwanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in\nbed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad\nluck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and\nsomething nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might\nlike I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the\ncriada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you\nsee something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself\nnot knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend\nwe were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is\ndos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head\nsometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres\nthe room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his\nwriting and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he\ndoes at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes\nmaking the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to\ntake in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house\nlike this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated\nperson Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with\nthe fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown\nthat I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long\nago in Walpoles

serve him right\nits all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery\nsaid O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of\ntears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I\nsuppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt\nhave made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to\nkiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his\nface as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes\nthere my brown part then Ill tell him I want  1 or perhaps 30/- Ill\ntell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he\nwont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women\ndo I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write\nhis name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it\nup besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided\nhe doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill\ndo the indifferent 1 or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes\nlike that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill\ntighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty

I\nlove flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of\nheaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and\nthe waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats\nand wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about\nthat would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all\nsorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the\nditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no\nGod I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why\ndont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or\nwhatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves\nfirst then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why\nbecause theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes\nI know them well who was the first person in the universe before there\nwas anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so\nthere you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising\ntomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the\nrhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat\nthe day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of\nseedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago\nmy God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a\nflower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that\nwas one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today\nyes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a\nwoman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the\npleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I\nwouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was\nthinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and\nHester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all\nbirds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the\npier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing\nround his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls\nlaughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the\nmorning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who\nelse from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market\nall clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half\nasleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the\nsteps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle\nthousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and\nturbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a sdhop\nand Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice\nhid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night\nand the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the\nwatchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown\ntorrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the\nglorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all\nthe queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and\nthe rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and\nGibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put\nthe rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a\nred yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well\nas well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again\nyes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and\nfirst I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could\nfeel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and\nyes I said yes I will Yes.\n"
