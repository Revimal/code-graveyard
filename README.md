# code-graveyard
The graveyard for code-snippets that abandoned from my projects due to the over-engineering.

I want to ignore any kind of issue about these deprecated codes,
  but you can report it on '[Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Revimal/code-graveyard/issues)' if you have problems using them,
  nonetheless.
